### Key Takeaways
- As expected, on average June has a higher average recorded temperature (74 degrees F). However, it is only about 4 degrees higher than December (71 degrees F).
- June temperatures appear to be relatively normal/ less volatile compared to December.
- December temperatures vary more drastically and aren't as even throughout the month. There is a larger range in temperatures from min to max for the month of December than there is for the month of June. This makes December slightly less predictable when it comes to temperature.
- Despite having a higher range, the median temperature for December is still relatively close to its average temperature. This means that there is a higher frequency of recordings close to the average temperature than for the min and max temps.

## Summary
Although it appears that Decembers temperatures vary more than June, December still has ideal weather conditions for surfing and eating ice cream. Although there is a slight drop in temperature in December, the temperatures don't vary drastically between the two months.

Some additional queries would help in determing the weather conditions:

1. Analyzing precipitation would be extremely beneficial. Rain can definitely deter individuals away from ice cream and surfing. Knowing how these months compare when it comes to percipitation can help determine the success of the business.
2. Analyzing each month instead of just June and December. Two months out of twelve does not provide a full picture and can not adequately summarize/ predict weather conditions for Oahu. It is a great start and supports the business opening, however more analysis is needed.
